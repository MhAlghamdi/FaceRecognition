# Attendance
The algorithm of this application records the attendance of the employees or students in a facility using data extracted from their faces and comparing it to an existing database of employees faces. 

The standard database used for face recognition was collected from [AT&T Laboratories Cambridge](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html "title"). The database contains 40 classes and each class has 10 images.
